# Handover
A webapp for medical staff on wards to efficiently handle their jobs and patient management.

Create a folder for the app inside it create another folder called 'handover'.
Put all the files except 'run.py' in that folder.
run 'run.py' (e.g: >python run.py)

The database currently still needs to be initialized with some beds. Just the bed number is required.
